**Notes:** 
- SciencePlots requires Latex ([see Latex installation instructions](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots/wiki/FAQ#installing-latex)). 
- If you would like to use CJK fonts, you will need to install these font separately ([see CJK font installation instructions](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots/wiki/FAQ#installing-cjk-fonts)).

Please see the [FAQ](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots/wiki/FAQ) for more information and troubleshooting.
